SOME NOTES
    - since python uses white-space for indenting code-blocks, I've been
      using 4-spaces to denote indention

    - item ID's. Items are stored in an array (list technicall) and the `Item ID` corresponds to it's position in the list. Item ID doesn't have an "interface" per-say, but is a front-end feature that allows easy translation from front-end to specific item.

    - Inspect - front end command to look at an item in more detail. This means that both ITEMS and WEAPONS need a toString method for inspection.
